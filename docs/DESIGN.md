# medi: Design & Architecture

* **Version**: 1.0
* **Status**: Proposed
* **Date**: 2025-08-08

This document outlines the design and guiding principles behind `medi`, a terminal-based markdown manager.

---

## 1. Vision & Purpose üéØ

**`medi`** is a command-line tool for creating and managing markdown-based notes, articles, and documentation. It's built for developers, writers, and anyone who prefers working in the terminal with an editor-centric workflow.

The goal is to provide a smooth path from idea to finished document, without leaving the command line.

## 2. Core Concepts

The system is built around a few simple concepts:

* **Note**
  A markdown file containing your content. Notes can be anything, from a one-liner to a detailed article.

* **Key**
  A unique, human-readable identifier (e.g. `cli-ideas`, `my-first-article`) used to reference a note.

* **Database (`db`)**: A `sled` key-value store that acts as the **primary source of truth** for all notes. It is the canonical storage layer where all content is managed, ensuring data integrity and fast access. The user interacts with this database exclusively through `medi` commands.

* **CLI Interface**
  The command-line interface is the only way to interact with `medi`. Built with `clap`, it exposes all functionality through clear commands and flags (e.g. `medi new`, `medi edit`).

## 3. High-Level Architecture & Workflow

`medi` follows a standard Rust ‚Äúlib + bin‚Äù structure to encourage separation of concerns and maintainability.

### üß≠ Typical Flow: `medi new "my-idea"`

1. **Command execution**
   The user runs a command in their shell.

2. **Argument parsing (`main.rs`)**
   The `clap` parser validates arguments and produces a `Cli` struct.

3. **Delegation (`main.rs` ‚Üí `lib.rs`)**
   `main.rs` passes control to `run()` in `lib.rs`, handing over the parsed CLI input.

4. **Command dispatch (`lib.rs`)**
   The `run()` function matches the command and calls the appropriate module function.

5. **Data handling (`lib.rs` ‚Üí `db.rs`)**
   For creation commands, `db.rs` handles storing and retrieving content from `sled`.

6. **Editor launch**
   Using the `edit` crate, `medi` opens the default `$EDITOR` in a new buffer.

7. **Content creation**
   The user writes, saves, and exits.

8. **Persistence**
   The content is captured and stored in the database using the assigned key.

9. **Result**
   Success or error messages are printed to the console.

This structure keeps `main.rs` thin and focused, while keeping application logic modular and testable.

## 4. Guiding Principles

These principles shape the design and usage of `medi`.

* **CLI-first**
  Everything is done through the terminal. There's no GUI and no intention to add one. The CLI should be easy to script and compose with other tools.

* **Editor-centric**
  Your text editor is where you write. `medi` isn't an editor, it just launches yours with the right buffer.

* **Local & private by default**
  All content stays on your local machine. No external services, no sync, no network traffic. Your data is yours.

* **Zero-config startup**
  `medi` should be usable immediately after install. Sensible defaults mean you don‚Äôt need to configure anything to get started (but you can if you want to).


## Detailed Command Reference

These commands will be implemented in `medi`

### Core Commands

* `medi new <key>`
    Launches the default text editor (`$EDITOR`) with a blank buffer. After the user saves and quits, the content is saved to the `sled` database under the provided `<key>`. If the key already exists, the operation is aborted with an error.

* `medi edit <key>`
    Retrieves the content for the given `<key>` from the database and loads it into the default text editor. Upon saving and quitting, the updated content replaces the old entry in the database. If the key does not exist, it fails with an error.

* `medi get <key>`
    Fetches the content for the given `<key>` from the database and prints it directly to standard output. This is useful for quick previews or for piping content to other tools (e.g., `medi get my-article | mdcat`).

* `medi list`
    Lists all keys currently stored in the database. The output is a simple, newline-separated list, suitable for scripting.

* `medi delete <key>`
    Removes the note associated with `<key>` from the database. It will typically prompt for confirmation to prevent accidental data loss (e.g., `medi delete my-note --force` to skip the prompt).

### Import/Export Commands

* `medi export <directory>`
    Reads every note from the `sled` database. For each note, it creates a new file, `directory/key.md`, containing the note's content. This command will create the target directory if it doesn't exist. It's the primary way to create a version-controllable snapshot of the database.

* `medi import <directory>`
    Reads every `.md` file from the specified directory. For each file, it uses the filename (without the `.md` extension) as the key and inserts the content into the database. This command will need flags to manage conflicts:
    * `--overwrite`: If a key from a file already exists in the database, its content will be replaced.
    * `--skip` (default): If a key already exists, the import for that specific file is skipped.
